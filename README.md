# Sweet Delights Bakery
## A Bakery Shop React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

## Step 1: Clone the Repository
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Change the current working directory to the location where you want to clone the repository.
3. Clone the repository using the following command:

git clone <repository_url>

### Replace <repository_url> with the URL of the Bakery website's Git repository.

## Step 2: Install Dependencies
1. Change into the cloned repository's directory:

cd <repository_name>

### Replace <repository_name> with the name of the cloned repository folder.

2. Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn (ensure you have Node.js installed):

npm install

or 

yarn install

## Step 3: Start the Development Server
1. Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server using npm or yarn:

npm run dev

or 

yarn run dev

2. The development server will compile the React components and start the website. It will also automatically open the website in your default web browser at http://localhost:5173/ (unless the port is already in use).

Now, you should be able to access and interact with the Bakery website locally. Any changes you make to the source code will trigger an automatic reload, allowing you to see the updates in real-time during development.
